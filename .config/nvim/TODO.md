# nvim config TODOs

My old config was so broken I'm not even sure what I need to get in
here to make myself happy. Here's stuff I can think of right now.


## basics

- [x] vim-surround or equivalent
- [x] vim-unimpaired or equivalent
- [x] vim-abolish or equivalent

## plugin management
- [x] add vinstall script to repo
- [ ] change script to use git-subrepo
- [ ] add ability to upgrade
- [ ] probably rewrite in python


## colours

nothing bright. maybe use typefaces over colours actually?


## vimwiki

- [ ] follow basic instructions
- [ ] move this TODO there?


## vcs
- [ ] vim-fugitive or gina or ???
- [ ] the blame browser thing
- [x] last commit for line
  - [ ] make it modal: keep it open when moving within file?


## lsp
- [ ] make it go
- [ ] make it have completion
- [ ] make it have diagnostics


## navigation / fuzzyfinding
- [x] make it go
- [ ] customise it?
